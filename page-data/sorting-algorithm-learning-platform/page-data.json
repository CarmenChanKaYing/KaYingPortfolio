User needs to register an account to use this platform. In this platform, the user is expected to understand the concept of insertion sort, selection sort, and bubble sort. Video, algorithm, time complexity and example of each type of sorting algorithm are provided. There is one exercise for each type of sorting method. Each exercise contains three levels of the question. After answer the questions, the result will be recorded and show on the profile page.","description":"Assignment of COMP3421 Web Application Design and Development - PolyU","github":"https://github.com/CarmenChanKaYing/SortingAlgorithmLearningPlatform"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
